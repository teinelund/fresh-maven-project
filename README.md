# Fresh Maven Project
A simple command line tool to create, an almost empty, maven project.

***

This is the first version of this application, so it is not so useful right now. But, hopefully some users will find it useful enough.

For this first version you can create a maven project: as a stand-alone console application.

## Why?
_Why is this useful?_ It is a fast way to create a maven application when you do small snippets of tests or POC (Proof of Concept) applications. The application is lightning fast to create a fresh project. It uses some sound applicationTypes. It will be useful for some projects, but not for all (console application) projects.

_Why not use, say maven-archetype-quickstart?_ You can do that, but you need to add a few applicationTypes your self, which in the long run is tiresome. With this application you can fine tune your application a little bit more. Stil, ti is quite crude. With future version you should be able to fine tune your application even more and create more types of application than console applications.
